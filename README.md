# AnticheatManager
Spigot Plugin to manage multiple anticheats for a test server for example.

# Code
It uses the LuckPerms API hardcoded, so if you don't use LuckPerms you have to recode it yourself, because im too lazy.
Code is pretty ugly, but it's only intented for private use on small scale, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
